            <h3>Skin Care</h3>

            <h3>Makeup Essentials</h3>
            <p>When it comes to makeup I like to keep it simple and sweet. While playing with makeup is always fun and allows you to be creative, the price of products can often be extremely expensive and honestly unncessary. Thats why I like to keep my makeup collection down to the necessities</p>
            <p>I also am a firm believer in that it is more important to splerge on good skincare products, because if you have a good canvas to start with it makes doing your makeup so much easier</p>
            <ul>
              <li>For primer I love the one by MILK Makeup because it really grips your foundation together</li>
              <li>My favorite foundation right now is definetly this one by Charolette Tilbury</li>
              <li>In addition, for my bronzer, blush and highlighter, I am BEYOND obsessed the Charolette Tilbury ones as well</li>
              <li>My current obsession for conceler is this one by NARS Cosmetics!</li>
              <li>Dior has some of the most gorgeous pigmented eyeshows that is a must to try! I promise its worth the price tag</li>
              <li>Finally, MILK Mascara gives my eyelashes the most volume out of any mascara I've ever tried</li>

            <h3>How to: Prevent Aging</h3>
            <p>While makeup and skincare is great and all, the most important part of your routine should always be taking preventative aging measures. Even though I am still young and my skin doesn't appear to have aged much, the sun and envrionment around you causes a whole lot of damage even if you cannot see it.<p>
            <p>If you want to make sure you aren't looking shriveled up one day, make sure you follow all of these tips, tricks and steps.<p>
            <p>First, it is MUST that you wear sunscreen everysingle day!!! Yes, I know everyone looks better with a tan, but there are other effective ways to achieve a glowing tan (my favorite is the <a href="https://theisleofparadise.com/tan-shop/?gclid=Cj0KCQjwyZmEBhCpARIsALIzmnJ-5G6gw3s4J2L3dRmLZDHdDhWw1m4TXa2AtInq_Ht8dHtOfTw-oAAaAv7CEALw_wcB">isle of paradise</a>)! It is also a necessity that you take good care of your skincare regimine and be diligent about it. Next, take anti-aging preventative measures. My favorite is using a retin-a called <a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/skin/tretinoin">tretinoin</a> Click on that link to learn all about the benefits of adding tretinoin into your skincare regimine! I promise you it checked my skin sooooo much.</p>
