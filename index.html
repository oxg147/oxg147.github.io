          <h3>Hi! I'm Liv</h3>
          <p>I'm so glad you've found me here! I'm excited for you to get to know all about what I love!</p>
          <p>I was born and raised in Long Island, NY and ever since I can remember I have loved everything related to beauty, makeup, skincare and fashion (on my 3rd birthday I got a fake makeup vanity!). I am a senior at the University of Miami about to graduate (go canes!) and I majored in Public Relations and minored in Marketing. I love the beauty industry so much that I had an internship at Briogeo Haircare last summer and plan on getting a job in the beauty industry once I graduate.</p>
          <p>I grew up in a house with 3 dogs, 3 siblings, a mom and dad and live in babysitter, so, you can say that house was definetly hectic! But, I wouldn't change it for the aboslute world! Growing up I always wanted to be just like my older sister so I would constantly put on outfits that made me look just like her, unfortunelty for my younger self though, she hated it!!</p>
          <p>My brother and I were always super close, I think that's probably because having 2 sisters was so crazy that he was my scapegoat haha!
          <p>Moving forward, when it came to sports growing up I was never too great at them because I hated being aggressive, but found a love for Rowing which I did from <time datetime="2011">2011</time> to <time datetime="2016">2016</time>. I loved the sport, but unforutnley injured one of my knees and had to quite. While that sucked it allowed me to find myself and all that I was passionate about.</p>
          <p>...<strong>SO</strong> here we are thought all the ups and downs and years of discovering who I am... welcome to my life!</p>
